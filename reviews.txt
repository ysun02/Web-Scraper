Most recent review for MATH119:

Nice and slow-paced class for people who are afraid of math. 3 tests and weekly quizzes are 85% of your grade! The quizzes (10%) are tough, mainly because of the time limit, but the tests are okay. TA sessions really help with the hw, and everything is graded fairly leniently (more emphasis on setting up the problem correctly than silly mistakes).

He is wicked smart and loves math, but his lectures move very fast and he has a really hard time gauging what his students do and do not understand.

If you want to learn a lot and don't care about your GPA (aren't premed), go ahead. Otherwise, beware. He explains things in class really well, but the assignments/tests are harshly graded.

Most recent review for FILM307:

Higgins was an incredible professor. He is extremely knowledgable about film, but remains humble rather than seeming patronizing or pretentious. He was a pretty tough grader on his tests and journals, as he was clearly looking for very specific answers to his questions, but his outstanding lectures make the class more than worthwhile.

Michael Roth is a talented lecturer and the class was easy to sit through because of that. That being said, the readings were interesting but he would always summarize them the next day in class. You're pretty much set if you go to class most of the time and look at the slides online for whatever you miss.

Most recent review for EES197:

He was a very distracting and boring professor. He is very knowledgable about the topic and cares deeply for the environment, but he acts as though we are environmental scientists ourselves and uses big terms that to us are confusing and detract our engagement. He is funny (to some) but as a professor this class was the worse for me.

AMAZING! Everything you've ever heard about her is true. Just take a class with her. Doesn't matter what one. Just do it. She could have spent a year lecturing about the mud on my boots, and I would have listened and loved it. Just take a class with her. It doesn't matter if you get a C (you won't), but really, just do it.
